# About me
Hello! Welcome to my homepage.

I am a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Biological Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I am a member of the antimalarial drug discovery team  supervised by 
[Prof. Jacquin C. Niles](https://web.mit.edu/nileslab/index.html)
, and my current research involves the use of functional genetics and high throughput chemical screening towards a quick and efficient discovery of novel antimalarial chemotypes to fight the drug resistance among malaria parasites.

I received my M.Sc. degree in Chemistry (specialization in organic chemistry) in 2013, and my Ph.D. degree in Chemistry in 2019 from Jadavpur University (Jadavpur, WB, India). From 2013 to 2019, I carried out my doctoral thesis work under the supervision of [Prof. (Dr.) Uday Bandyopadhyay](http://www.jcbose.ac.in/faculty-details/uday-bandyopadhyay), where I was involved in the design and synthesis of novel small molecules and their biological evaluation towards the discovery of new antimalarials.
